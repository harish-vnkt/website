I am a Data Scientist at [AppZen](https://www.appzen.com/). In this blog, I intend to write about the non-intuitive and quirky aspects of deep learning, AI and computer science, and also use it to record walkthroughs of some of my personal projects that will eventually serve as a reference for future-me (or anybody else who has the time to read). I might even ocassionally indulge in some personal reflection here, mainly to talk about travel, books and movies (yes, I am a geek in some aspects), but suffice to say that __all thoughts here are my own and bear no affiliations__. I mainly code in Python, but I tend to use whatever gets the job done. My interests lie in the intersection between machine learning, system design, and software development. I am fascinated by the design principles behind popular ML frameworks today such as Pytorch and JAX, and plan to write about the many obscure aspects about these frameworks as I journey through learning and understanding them better.
