### Publications

- Hierarchical data visualization and experimental erythrocyte aggregation employing cross-correlation and optical flow applications. [Microvascular Research, Volume 143](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0026286222000760)

### Projects

- **Multi-scale Residual Networks for Super-Resolution** - [GitHub](https://github.com/harish-vnkt/multiscale-residual-network-pytorch)
    - Tech Stack - Python, Pytorch, OpenCV, Numpy
    - I trained a deep learning model for the purpose of super-resolution. The model can super-resolve images by 2x and 4x, and the neural network architecture is based on the paper "[Multi-scale Residual Networks for Image Super-Resolution](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ECCV_2018/papers/Juncheng_Li_Multi-scale_Residual_Network_ECCV_2018_paper.pdf)". The training dataset is the [Div2K dataset](https://www.google.com/search?q=div2k+dataset&oq=div2k+dataset&aqs=chrome..69i57j0.3390j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8).

- **Structure from Motion** - [GitHub](https://github.com/harish-vnkt/structure-from-motion)
    - Tech Stack - Python, OpenCV, Numpy
    - I designed a module for incremental structure from motion which reconstructs the 3D structure of a scene as a point cloud based on multiple 2D images of the scene.

- **Design Pattern Code Generator** - [GitHub](https://github.com/harish-vnkt/design-pattern-code-generator)
    - Tech Stack - Java, Eclipse ASTParser, JUnit
    - I built a module that generates boilerplate code for different design patterns like abstract factory, builder, and facade. The code generation is done by building custom abstract syntax trees specific to the structure of the given design patterns using Eclipse's ASTParser package.

- **Widgeting Around** - [GitHub](https://github.com/harish-vnkt/ar-widgets), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjU75HUAG7Y&ab_channel=HarishVenkataraman)
    - Tech Stack - C#, Unity, Vuforia
    - I built an augmented reality application that shows different widgets on image markers from the Vuforia Mars database. The widgets show information like date, time, and weather .

- **Augmented Humanoid** - [GitHub](https://github.com/harish-vnkt/ar-humanoid), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GlNHi4cvig&feature=youtu.be&ab_channel=HarishVenkataraman)
    - Tech Stack - C#, Unity, Vuforia, MakeHuman
    - I built an augmented reality application that displays a miniature humanoid performing an animation over image markers from the Vuforia Mars database.
